our project2 for AGI13
==========
bpl_source, only commit text-files to GIT, GIT can get terribly slow when you commit binary files.
bpl_binary, we'll put all binary our files here. we'll sync them with dropbox and you can make a symbolic link to this folder if you want to.
Windows Console Command to make symbolic links (short cuts that are transparent for programs)
mklink /D bpl_binary "D:\Dropbox\bpl_binary"
